# foodBook

### Description
  foodBook is a Django application that can be used to keep track of kitchen inventory. Users will ideally be able to scan 
  in receipts, scan barcodes, or manually update their food items. With this functionality users will also be able to search
  and favorite recipes from Edamam API. Off of their inventory and recipe requirements, the application can provide a "shopping
  list" of what ingredients, and how much of each, are needed for the recipe. The app can also recommend recipes to users based
  on what inventory they have in their kitchen.
